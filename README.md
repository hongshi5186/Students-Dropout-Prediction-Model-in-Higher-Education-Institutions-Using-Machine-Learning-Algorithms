# Students-Dropout-Prediction-Model-in-Higher-Education-Institutions-Using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms
Student dropout is considered the most complex and significnt issue in the education system.
This problem causes economic, social, academic, political, and financial damage to the main
agents of education i.e., from the student to the governmental and promotional agencies for
effective and efficient strategies to minimize the indexex of school dropout, so that the measures
adopted can have a positive effect on the problem. To successfully reduce student dropout,
it is imperative to understand what the underlying determinants of dropout rates are and
which students are at risk of dropping out. Therefore, early identification of potential dropout
students is very imperative. Here we analyzed educational data and generated predictive
models for student dropout using neural networks (NN), decision trees (DT), naive Bayes
(NB), support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) algorithms to identify student
characteristics which distinguish potential dropouts from graduates.
